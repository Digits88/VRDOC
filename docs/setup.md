## STEP #1— THEME INSTALLATION

!!! warning "INSTALL WORDPRESS"
    In start you must have a working version of WordPress already installed. For information in regard to installing the WordPress CMS, please see the WordPress Codex [Installing WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress).

Once you have a working version of WordPress, you need to do the following

1. **DOWNLOAD** the theme files (which contain both the theme and related documents).
2. **EXTRACT** the downloaded **zip** file.
3. **OPEN** the folder called `01- Theme` to find the installable theme zip file called **vr.zip*
4.  **INSTALL** the theme by uploading **vr.zip** in your WordPress website.

    So, it goes like this. You download the theme files you bought, you extract them in your computer and inside the theme folder `01- Theme` you find **vr.zip** file which is the theme file you need to upload in your WordPress.

###Install Theme Via WordPress Dashboard

- Access your WordPress site admin area. 
- Go to `Appearance > Themes` section.
- Click `Add New` button and select the ‘Upload Theme’ option
- Choose the **vr.zip** file and click `Install Now`
- Once the theme is uploaded you need to activate it.

    If you face any problem during upload through dashboard, please upload the theme using FTP as guided below.

- Extract the **vr.zip** file in your PC.
- Access your hosting server using an FTP client e.g. FileZilla.
- Go to the `wp-content/themes` folder of your WordPress installation.
- Upload the `vr` folder (you extracted) to the `wp-content/themes/` folder.
